Another book that could be helpful is 'Shakespeare's Words: A Glossary and Language Companion' edited by David Crystal and Ben Crystal.

It provides explanations and definitions for the vocabulary used in Shakespeare's works. Another book that could be helpful is 'Shakespeare's Words: A Glossary and Language Companion' edited by David Crystal and Ben Crystal. It offers a comprehensive guide to the language used by Shakespeare, including word definitions, historical context, and examples. I found both of these books really useful for analyzing the language in Macbeth and Hamlet."

It provides an extensive glossary of dramatic terms and their explanations, which can be applied to analyzing language in various plays. Another book that could be useful is 'Style in Fiction: A Linguistic Introduction to English Fictional Prose' by Geoffrey Leech and Mick Short. It explores the stylistic features and language techniques used in fictional literature. I hope you find these resources beneficial!"

Another book that could be helpful is 'Shakespeare's Words: A Glossary and Language Companion' edited by David Crystal and Ben Crystal. It offers a comprehensive guide to the language used by Shakespeare, including word definitions, historical context, and examples. I found both of these books really useful for analyzing the language in Macbeth and Hamlet."

Another book that could be useful is 'Style in Fiction: A Linguistic Introduction to English Fictional Prose' by Geoffrey Leech and Mick Short.
